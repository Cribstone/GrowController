### So what does this thing do, anyway?

GrowController aims to be a modular and scalable hydroponics automation system. Each controller monitors one reservoir and associated hardware (lights, climate control, CO2, and more) and exposes a well-designed web app for analyzing logged data as well as an API so that future software can be developed to network multiple GrowControllers together.

Acting on the logged data, GrowController can keep your reservoir topped off and dose up to 8 nutrients via peristaltic pump to maintain a target EC. Target EC and pH levels may be configured at daily resolution.

### Overview of data recorded

The various data recorded include:

* Water pH
* Water EC
* Water Temperature
* Water Level
* Air Temperature
* Air Humidity
* Lights On/Off
* CO2 PPM
* Flood Detection

### Overview of available output

A serial 16x2 display shows realtime data and /16 address. Relay outputs are also provided for software controlled:

* Lights (15A Solid State)
* Irrigation Pump
* Cooling
* Heating
* Humidifier
* Dehumidifer
* CO2
* Exhaust Fan
* Rez Fill Pump
* 8x Nutrient Pumps

### Materials

The list below may be non-comprehensive, I will add to it as I evaluate and choose parts:

* Beaglebone Black (1GHz Cortex A8 w/ 512MB DDR3L & 2GB eMMC)
* Edimax USB WiFi b/g/n adapter (RTl8192cu chipset)
* Opto 22 (Solid State Relay)
* Parallax Serial 16x2 Backlit LCD
